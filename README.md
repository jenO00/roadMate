# roadMate

This project was created for the course TDDD27, Advanced Web Development, at Link√∂ping University.

roadMate is inteded to be an app where users can find people to travel with, share travel stories and find new places to travel. 
The code was developed together with my co-coder Helena. The design was created on figma.

At the moment, the code has passed the course, but I intend to add the features that are yet to be included in the project such as: 
- Settings, to put in what kind of person you would like to travel with. Such as: gender, age, interests. 
- Chat. 
- Nicer design on reviews. 
- Profile pictures. 
- Possibility to upload pictures.
